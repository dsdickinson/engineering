# Pytorch - Jetson Orin Nano - CUDA Arch 8.7 wheel files

These files were built from source in order to get compatible versions for my Jetson Orin Nano, which currently has CUDA 8.7 capabilities.
The current and latest versions of pytorch (currently v2.6.0) do not support this CUDA capability.

An explanation of the wheel build process can be found here:<br/>
