# Pytorch - Jetson Orin Nano wheel files

These files were built from source in order to get compatible versions for my Jetson which currently has 8.7 capabilities.
The current and latest versions of pytorch (currently v2.6.0) do not support this capability.

Explanation on the wheel build process can be found here:
